# Tox-screening
Screening and evaluating plant-derived compounds for reproductive and developmental toxicity using in-silico, in-vitro, and systems biology approaches.
# Plant-Derived Molecules for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Assessment  

This repository is part of my journey into **computational biology, computational toxicology, and drug discovery**.  
It focuses on leveraging **in silico methods** to evaluate **plant-derived compounds** for their potential impact on **developmental and reproductive health**, as well as their opportunities in **drug development and phytotherapy**.  

## üî¨ Project Overview
This project integrates:
- **Computational Toxicology (CompTox):** Using QSAR, molecular docking, and toxicity prediction models.  
- **Developmental & Reproductive Biology:** Assessing how phytochemicals may influence embryonic and reproductive systems.  
- **Omics & Systems Biology:** Linking plant compounds to gene/protein targets and pathways.  
- **Drug Design & Phytotherapy:** Exploring therapeutic potential while evaluating toxicological safety.  
- **One Health & Environmental Toxicology:** Considering the cross-talk between human, animal, and environmental exposures.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Frameworks
- **VS Code** (main development environment)  
- **Docking Tools**: AutoDock Vina, PyRx, SwissDock  
- **Databases**: PubChem, ChEMBL, ToxCast, NPASS (Natural Products Atlas)  
- **Computational Tools**: SwissADME, pkCSM, ProTox-II, VEGA QSAR  
- **Visualization**: PyMOL, Chimera, Cytoscape  

## üìÇ Repository Structure

## üìä Example Research Topics
1. **In Silico Assessment of Phytochemicals for Developmental Toxicity Using Docking and QSAR Models**  
2. **Computational Exploration of Plant-Derived Compounds as Safer Alternatives in Reproductive Health Therapies**  

## üöÄ Roadmap
- [ ] Collect phytochemical structures from PubChem/NPASS  
- [ ] Perform docking against reproductive/developmental targets (e.g., estrogen receptor, CYP enzymes, DNA-binding proteins)  
- [ ] Run ADMET and toxicity predictions  
- [ ] Visualize pathway and omics-level interactions  
- [ ] Prepare results for publication
